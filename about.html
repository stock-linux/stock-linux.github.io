        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold stock-blue">What's the purpose of Stock Linux ?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>The purpose of Stock Linux is to create a new distribution that can be source-based and binary-based at the same time.<br/>
            Indeed, with Stock Linux, you can compile pre-made packages or you can create your custom package or you can download a generated binary of the same package.<br/>That's a lot of choices and that's the purpose of the distro.<br/>I think GNU/Linux should be the perfect customizable OS but without any waste of time like compilation time even if this could bring some special features. </p>
        <br/>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold stock-blue">Is Stock Linux really hard to install ?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>I could say yes but I could say no. It's really hard to determine.<br/> If you have some experience in the Linux world, if you can install Arch Linux without much problems, you can install Stock Linux easily. It's just a guide to follow !<br/> Follow the steps and there you go ! Our package manager hasn't options like USE flags etc so the experience is really easy.<br/> If you want to customize your packages, just learn to compile. If you want to have great performances, just use squirrel with basic options. If you don't have the time to compile, download the binaries ! It's really easy. </p>
